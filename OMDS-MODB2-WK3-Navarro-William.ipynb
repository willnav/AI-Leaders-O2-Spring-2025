    "Let's make a dataset (in this case, just a series) which is weighted to have more small values than large values.  By squaring a random number between 0 and 1, we ensure that half (those whose initial value is below 0.5) are below 0.25, while the other half are between 0.25 and 1.  This means that most of the values are small, and it's more interesting than analyzing a perfectly uniform dataset.  This kind of trick - transforming one random variable to get another - can generate a variety of random datasets for you.  We then multiply by 100 to get a number between 0 and 100."

This time, to construct the data I used a fourth power rather than squaring, with only 100 data points, so that the points are even more concentrated toward the small numbers.  It turns out that this will create a more interesting boxplot.  The top and bottom edges of the box are the 75th and 25th percentile, respectively, and the top and bottom \"whiskers\" show a larger range which is a multiple of 1.5 times the the box height.  (The bottom whisker cannot be see because it's pushed against the bottom of the graph.)  The filled-in box shows that half of the values are between about 0 and 30 on the y-axis.  Is that what you'd expect?  The 25th and 75th percentile of the original uniform random variable are at 0.25 and 0.75.  Taken to the fourth power and multiplied by 100 (remember, that's how we constructed our sample), that's 0.25\\*\\*4 * 100 = 0.4 and 0.75\\*\\*4 * 100 = 32.
